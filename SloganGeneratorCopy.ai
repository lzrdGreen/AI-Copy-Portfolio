Can AI Generate Killer Taglines?

Give it a try and judge for yourself.

I used the free service Free Slogan Generator by Copy.ai (https://www.copy.ai/tools/slogan-generator). I attempted to generate taglines for leading advertising agencies and compared them to the top taglines from my previous post.

I utilised two prompts twice: " Write slogans for a universal advertising firm” and
“Advertisig firm with Values (Client First, Data-Driven Creativity, Collaborative Innovation) and Personality (Strategic, Bold and Creative,Results-Oriented)”. This resulted in 40 taglines, which were subsequently evaluated by various free AI models, considering perspectives from both the Marketing Director and the broader viewpoint of the SEO and CFO, who require fresh and effective marketing campaigns. From this assessment, 8 taglines emerged as successful, meeting the criteria set forth by both perspectives.

To establish a comparison benchmark, I included the 4 "winning" taglines from the previous post and replicated the same ranking process precisely.
Unexpectedly, one tagline generated through this semi-automated procedure (with minimal human intervention limited to crafting somewhat clumsy prompts) emerged as a winner: "Data-Driven Creativity for Client-Focused Results." It was closely trailed by a tagline from the previous post: "Elevate Your Strategy: Where Data Meets Creativity."
Three other taglines from the previous post performed reasonably well, securing positions in the top half of the list. Notably, one tagline generated semi-automatically also made it: "Bold Ideas. Strategic Results. Client-Focused Creativity."
So, what's the takeaway? It's unsurprising that generative AI models significantly benefit from human touch. However, even a rudimentary crafting process using prompts can yield great results with some luck. However, the fact that 38 out of the 40 taglines generated with prompts were mediocre or subpar underscores the critical importance of human intervention, even if it occurs at a later stage.


Jasper, a competitor of Copy.ai, does not offer a specialized template for generating slogans and taglines. However, they “generously” shared an article on how to produce them using their tools/templates, which are available for a monthly subscription fee at: https://www.jasper.ai/tools/slogan-generator
