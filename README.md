This repo contains text files with [my posts on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-parshakov/) dedicated to AI generated taglines, slogans and jingles

Taglines (brand statement) are short, memorable phrases that encapsulate a brand's essence, values, and personality. They are typically 3-8 words long and are used consistently across all marketing materials to build brand recognition

Brand identity: brand essence, values, and personality.
The brand essence tends to be closely tied to the company's core competencies and what it does best.
It encapsulates the company's purpose, unique positioning, and emotional appeal, which are rooted in its key strengths and capabilities.

Slogans are also short, catchy phrases, but they are more campaign-specific and tend to change more frequently than taglines. Slogans are often used in advertising and marketing campaigns to make a specific claim or call to action, CTA.

Jingle -a short slogan, verse, or tune designed to be easily remembered, especially as used in advertising.

Target audience - understand it!
Their needs and pain points; needs, motivations, and preferences

Search intent defines keywords for SEO. Tailor the messaging / your copy to resonate with the audience, with their specific needs

Take into account Client's brand voice (and style guidelines)

The 4 Ps of marketing: product, price, place, and promotion.

Product: differentiation factors, unique selling points, benefits (=value proposition). It defines the industry a client company belongs to.

SEO, relevant keywords 
-> specific search intent behind the target keywords, whether that's informational, navigational, or transactional.

Use power words! 
Power Words = Emotional Words Packed with Persuasion
