Growth hacking
Imagine catapulting your user base with a single, irreverent video. That's the power of growth hacking: low-cost, creative, and data-driven  marketing strategies. Just look at Dollar Shave Club - their $4,500 video (warning: profanity) went viral on YouTube, with over 28 million views, amassing millions of customers and a billion-dollar acquisition. 

Growth hacking ignites rapid user acquisition, akin to a wildfire or an avalanche gaining momentum. It's become a go-to strategy for companies across industries, fuelling growth:

    • Uber: Leverages surge pricing to manage demand and supply effectively, optimising profitability while maintaining service levels.
    • Airbnb: Disrupted the hospitality market with a peer-to-peer rental platform and capitalising on platforms like Craigslist for user acquisition.
    • Dropbox: Viral referral program drove rapid expansion through word-of-mouth. Similar tactics saw success for Uber and Airbnb. 
Some used growth hacking alongside other strategies :
    • PayPal: Leveraged partnerships and integration with platforms like eBay to tap into existing user bases and drive customer acquisitions in a broader marketing mix.
    • Spotify: Uses freemium and free trial models to convert users into paying customers, maximising acquisition and retention. But brand marketing and content creation played a role too. Spotify partners with Uber and Starbucks for seamless music integration.
    • Slack: Excels with a winning duo: top-notch product development and a seamless onboarding experience to convert new users into active users.
    • HubSpot: Uses content that establishes the brand as a thought leader and attracts users seeking solutions, driving growth through scalable and cost-effective inbound marketing tactics including SEO and social media.
    • Duolingo: Gamifies language-learning to keep users engaged. Drives growth through user retention and organic user acquisition, while prioritising user experience and learning effectiveness. 
Beyond growth hacking, fostering passionate brand advocates like Apple, Starbucks, and Tesla fuels organic growth. McDonald's strategically placed restaurants during the US auto boom, demonstrating the power of location. Early Facebook used viral tactics like tagging to rapidly acquire users. 
Grasping the basics of growth hacking unveils its effectiveness:
    • Product-Market Fit: No amount of hacking can save a product users don't love. 
    • Scalability: Ensure that your business can handle exponentially fast expansion.
    • Pick Clear Growth Metric: new user number or customer engagement?
    • Be Agile!: Experiment, learn, and adapt quickly.
    • Retention is King: Engaged users drive growth – understand their needs and personalise their journey.
