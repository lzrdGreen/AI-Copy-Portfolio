"Unleash Innovation with Amazon Bedrock" or "Unlock the Future of AI on Amazon Bedrock"? Which slogan is better for Amazon in the ongoing (now escalating) competition for market share between AWS and Azure in the Cloud Computing industry?

The choice hinges on your perspective on the term "AI": is it an overused buzzword or a clear indication of the battleground?

If neither slogan appeals, consider two alternative slogans: "Amazon Bedrock: Where AI Imagination Takes Root" versus "Build on Bedrock. Unleash Generative AI Power."
