"The future takes Visa" vs "World Mastercard: More living. Less limits." In the past five years, MasterCard's share price has surged by 103%, outpacing Visa's increase of 77%. Seems odd, right?

Both companies offer pretty much the same stuff (product lines, core competencies, both are widely accepted internationally) but Visa is way bigger, with 838 million cards out there compared to MasterCard's 388 million. Plus, Visa handles 40% of global card transactions, while Mastercard manages 24%.

Some analysts attributed MasterCard's success, at least in part, to its robust performance in overseas markets, hence the 'world' in their tagline versus Visa's 'future'.

But a closer look at financial metrics such as revenue ($32.7 bn for Visa vs $25.1 bn for MasterCard in 2023, i.e. $39.0 vs $64.7 per card in circulation) or net income ($17,3 bn for Visa vs $11.19 bn for MasterCard in 2023, i.e. $20.6 vs $28.8 per card in circulation), reveals another perspective, hinting there might be more to MasterCard's success than just global reach.
