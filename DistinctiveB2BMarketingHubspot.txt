Distinctive B2B Marketing Campaigns

The CRM/ Marketing Automation landscape was dominated by outbound tactics in 2004 – intrusive ads, cold calls, email blasts, events... HubSpot emerged and challenged that with "inbound marketing." This customer-centric approach focused on attracting, engaging, and delighting audiences with valuable content, HubSpot’s “Inbound” campaign flipped the script on traditional marketing. 

Lead Generation
Instead of chasing leads, HubSpot attracts them with valuable content (blog management, SEO, CTAs, conversion optimisation) and social media engagement. Their all-in-one platform streamlines the process. By offering lead magnets like ebooks and webinars, you capture valuable contact information and convert website visitors into qualified leads. Automatic lead nurturing with targeted emails based on specific triggers and actions sets HubSpot apart from traditional outbound tactics and fosters a cohesive customer journey.
